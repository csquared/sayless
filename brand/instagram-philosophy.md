# Instagram Philosophy for SAYLESS

## Core Philosophy: I'll Remix Anything

Including Instagram itself. The platform becomes another instrument, another thing to hack and repurpose.

## Living Examples

### Story Remixing
- Taking heavy quotes and flipping them with unexpected music
- Example: Bukowski's "Let what loves you kill you" + "First Time" + swaggy Texas Rhythm House track
- Creating new meaning through audio/visual juxtaposition

### Consistent Story Approach
- Promoting friends' music
- Leaking bangers
- Showcasing fresh drops
- Creative audio layering over any content

## The "Follow the Rabbit" Approach

Multi-phase tactical community building:
- Drop breadcrumbs, not the whole loaf
- Show enough that people understand something different is happening
- Let the curious ones dig deeper

## Key Principles

- Remix culture in real-time
- Support the underground community
- Subvert platform conventions
- Make your mark without advertising
- Show, don't tell

## The Funnel: Instagram â†’ justsayless.xyz

All paths lead to the website:
- Instagram profile links to justsayless.xyz
- Website entrance: simple "Enter Here" breadcrumb
- Inside: glitchy logos revealing other worlds
- Unreleased tracks waiting for those who dig
- Web audio player as reward for the curious

The full experience lives beyond Instagram - the platform is just the invitation.
