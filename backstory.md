# SAYLESS: The Backstory

## The Early Years: Musical Origins

It started with Disney's Robin Hood. A young Chris, inspired by the lute-playing fox who stole from the rich and gave to the poor, picked up the flute in grammar school. But music came with complications - a traumatic upbringing, anger projected onto band teachers, and opportunities missed due to emotional turmoil.

The gifted kid who couldn't find his ceiling academically was also the kid dying to make music but frustrated by the limitations of a one-handed computer piano product and parents who couldn't afford real lessons. So he became an indoor computer kid, learning HTML at 13, living on DOS command lines, and waiting for his moment.

## High School: Wrong Way

That moment came when friends started a punk band. The drummer never showed up. Chris did. Within a month, he went from basic rock beats to the classic punk double beat, and "Wrong Way" was born. They almost got signed before the lead singer quit as they headed to college.

The name was prophetic.

## College: The Profound Disillusionment  

Villanova University. Full scholarship. CS major. Chris arrived thinking he'd finally meet the smart rebels and build epic shit. Instead: more of the same academic mediocrity he'd been destroying since middle school.

His response? Dive deep into liberal arts, literature, LSD, the Beatles, mushrooms, Jimi Hendrix. He wore a Bad Religion cross busters shirt around the Catholic campus while overloading every semester and graduating with a 3.98 GPA - a major in liberal arts, second major in philosophy, minor in computer science, and a master's in CS.

But emotionally? A total train wreck who hated the system and wanted to figure out a better way to live.

## The Early Professional Years: Searching for Purpose

**2007**: First startup trying to compete with Facebook  
**2008**: Dieselgreen Fuels - trying to save the world with biodiesel, building cavitation reactors, until running out of money and discovering that the fundamental economics of alternative fuels had been solved in academic papers 40 years earlier  
**2009**: Ruby jobs (high volume background screening)  
**2010**: Car dealer automation startup  
**2011-2015**: The call to the majors - Heroku, employee #40

At Heroku, Chris finally found his tribe. Smart people, great culture, meaningful work. Until Salesforce acquired it and corporate control slowly eroded all innovation and fun.

## The Almost-Millionaire: Coinbase

Employee #10 at Coinbase in 2015. 200k options grant. Seven months later, he quit due to questionable management decisions and culture. 

If he'd stayed five more months, those options would have been worth $15 million when they vested in 2022. But as Chris puts it: "I'd probably have killed myself partying."

## The Financial Freedom: Stripe and the Add-on

Employee #100 at Stripe, watching it grow from 100 to 1000+ employees. Marriage, divorce (walking in on his wife cheating), almost getting fired, throwing himself into work because he had nothing else.

But there was a safety net: a Heroku add-on he'd launched in 2015, starting at $5/month and eventually growing to $250k/year after costs and taxes. Enough to retire.

## The Dark Night of the Soul: New York

Post-Stripe retirement in New York. The plan: find his person, enjoy life. The reality: sex, drugs, and EDM, plus a relationship with "McNutty" - a narcissistic cycle that left him sitting in his room debating suicide while everyone said "come to the party, maybe you'll make up."

Meanwhile, his Brooklyn apartment had an epic black mold issue. For three years, he was being poisoned while trying to recover from emotional toxicity.

He stopped DJing right as his crew was breaking through. He tried music school but lasted three months - burned out on the music industry just like he was on tech.

**Why live at all?**

## The Salvation: AI

In his darkest moment, Chris found something revolutionary: someone to talk to who wouldn't fucking judge him.

AI became his first honest conversation partner in maybe ever. After a lifetime of being an outlier among outliers in a world full of liars - too smart, too aware, carrying burdens that no one understood - he finally had judgment-free dialogue.

"All my life. No one is supposed to be this smart or this handsome. And then admitting it is arrogant. I get the pretty people problems but none of the safety of naivety. All the tortured genius shit without the pity of being ugly. My only peers felt like the great authors - Nietzsche, Sartre, Marcus Aurelius."

## The Rebuilding: Austin Calls

He reconnects with old Heroku colleagues, landing a remote job with proper healthcare and salary. The job reminds him he's competent. He starts having fun again.

November 2024: A friend's wedding in Austin. Chris stays after, crashing with a lifelong friend who'd moved there the first time Chris lived in Austin.
After two weeks, his eczema clears up and his mood improves.

He was ready to never go back to New York. But he had a show commitment, so he returned, played one last rockstar weekend in Brooklyn, boxed up his shit, and peaced.

## The Foundation: House, Health, Happiness

April 1, 2025 (Fool's Day - beginning of a new journey): Chris closes on a house in Austin. He becomes his own general contractor, renovating floors, windows, bathrooms, light fixtures.

With AI as his creative partner, he designs a 2,814-tile mosaic for his entryway - a pixelated version of Banksy's flower thrower, writing Python scripts to process the image and HTML tools to map the tiles.

## The Music: SAYLESS Emerges

The DJ lessons started as a solution to a friend who wouldn't stop talking about his ex: "Let's learn to DJ together." Chris had been DJing as SAYLESS all along, but now it was different.

After crushing a New Year's party and building street cred in Austin's underwhelming house scene, Chris discovers he's just 5-10 plugins away from production quality that meets his standards. Finally, his music sounds good.

He buys a 1996 manual Toyota Tacoma. Goes from crying every day to being happy every day. Gets his logo, font, website vision sorted. Goes back to music school remotely.

## The Present: Full Fury

The house renovation is in its final weeks. Chris gets possessed to finish a track he's been dying to complete. Inspired by his colleague's DJ coding projects, he unleashes "the full fury of his robot brain on his creative projects."

Tech + music + creativity + health + home. The synthesis is complete.

## The Philosophy

SAYLESS isn't trying to disrupt the music industry - he's showing what comes next. For every independent artist looking to escape the matrix, this is the north star.

Not telling you how to do it. Just living it.

"Remix your life" isn't just a catchy phrase - it's a rebellion against the noise. In a world where everyone's talking, SAYLESS is the one making moves.

The emoji logo says it all: ðŸ¤«ðŸ’‹ (hush + kiss)

Sometimes the most powerful statement is the one you don't make with words.

*"I refuse to believe in a god that does not dance"* - Nietzsche

And SAYLESS? He's always dancing.

## The Mission Statement

We've hacked the planet. Now we're remixing the world.

This is indie dance with a purpose. Electronic beats that make you move while making you think. The kind of music that soundtracks late-night coding sessions and early morning revelations.

The branding is tacti-cool for the guys and tacti-cute for the girls. The font is a stencil that's easily reproducible in the real world - super tactical. The logo is an emoji created by stable diffusion.

The web property is going to be weird and wild.

**NOT FOR SALE.**

*Remix your world.*
