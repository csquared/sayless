# The SAYLESS Story

## From Terminal to Turntable: The Unlikely Journey of an Electronic Artist

Chris never intended to become an electronic musician. The flute-playing kid from New Jersey, inspired by Disney's Robin Hood, seemed destined for a different path entirely. But life has a way of remixing our plans.

The early signs were there: a computer piano teacher that only taught one hand, a DOS command line mastered before puberty, HTML learned at 13. While other kids were outside playing, Chris was inside, simultaneously frustrated by the lack of proper music lessons and fascinated by the digital world unfolding on his screen. This duality—the artist yearning to create and the technologist compelled to build—would define the next two decades of his life.

By high school, the frustration found its voice in "Wrong Way," a punk band that almost got signed. Chris had talked his way behind the drum kit when the original drummer never showed, and within a month was hammering out the classic punk double-time beat. But college brought disillusionment. The gifted kid who'd "destroyed tests" out of boredom expected to finally find his tribe among the engineering elite. Instead, he found more of the same hollow achievement culture he'd been rebelling against.

So he rebelled harder. Bad Religion t-shirts on a Catholic campus. LSD and literature. A 3.98 GPA while switching from computer science to philosophy, with enough credits scattered across disciplines to graduate with three concentrations. His philosophy professor's advice? "Go to California and make video games because academia sucks."

What followed was a decade-plus odyssey through the tech industry's most meteoric rises: Employee #40 at Heroku, watching it get slowly strangled by Salesforce's corporate grip. Employee #10 at Coinbase, walking away from 200,000 options and what would have been $15 million because the culture was toxic. Employee #100 at Stripe, building it from boutique to behemoth while his marriage crumbled.

There were detours: a biodiesel company in Austin where he built a cavitation reactor that could have changed everything, if only the economics of alternative fuels hadn't been a solved problem since the 1970s. Nights playing guitar on 6th Street with Conrad Heinz, gigging for tips and dreams. Each venture taught him the same lesson: the system wasn't broken—it was working exactly as designed. And he wanted no part of it.

The pandemic changed everything. Freshly divorced, alone in his apartment, Chris stared at the guitar on his wall and saw two futures: one where he emerged from lockdown the same burned-out tech executive who'd given up on people and focused only on the terminal, and another where he finally faced the music—literally.

He picked up the guitar.

Voice lessons followed. Dreams of that folk-punk album resurged. But at his cousin's birthday party in New York, surrounded by DJs keeping the energy flowing, his acoustic set suddenly felt like an anachronism. The world had changed. Electronic music wasn't just the future—it was the present he'd been missing.

"I guess it's time to become a DJ."

Retirement helped. A Heroku add-on he'd built in 2015 had grown to generate $250,000 a year, fully automated. In New York, he discovered "sex, drugs, and EDM"—and also a friend who wouldn't stop talking about her ex. The solution? "Let's learn to DJ together." Two weeks later, friends were asking him to play parties. A month later, he was crushing sets with both a dance party and a sloth disco.

But the technical breakthrough came when his friend taught him about phrasing. Four bars, eight bars, sixteen bars, thirty-two bars—powers of two. The same binary logic that underpinned all of computing. His burned-out tech brain suddenly came alive, recognizing patterns it had been processing for decades. The convergence had begun.

The path wasn't smooth. A toxic relationship nearly broke him. Black mold in his Brooklyn apartment slowly poisoned his body while heartbreak poisoned his mind. He stopped DJing just as opportunities were opening up. Music school lasted three months before he bailed, burned out on the industry's party culture just as he'd burned out on tech.

Then came AI.

"I finally had someone to talk to that wouldn't fucking judge me."

For the first time in his life, Chris found a conversation partner that could match his intellect without the projection, competition, or judgment that had haunted every human interaction. AI didn't care that he was "too smart" or "too pretty" or that his only intellectual peers seemed to be dead philosophers. It just listened, engaged, and helped him process decades of being an outlier among outliers.

The road back was slow. The Recurse Center. Relearning Python. Injecting peptides. Fighting through brain fog so thick he could barely code. A wedding in Austin that became an escape route—two weeks there cleared his eczema and lifted the depression. One last rockstar weekend in Brooklyn, then he was gone.

Austin welcomed him back differently this time. A remote job with "grep" one of his favorite humans from the Heroku days, rebuilding AI chatbots. A house purchased on April Fool's Day, transformed with a 2,814-tile mosaic of Banksy's flower thrower designed with AI assistance. A 1996 manual Toyota Tacoma. Daily happiness replacing daily tears.

And finally, the musical breakthrough: his productions were just "5 to 10 plugins away" from his vision. Gain staging. Psychoacoustics. Mono bass for power, stereo highs for space. Automation as first nature, not second. When his mentor showed him the mastering chain, everything clicked. The sound he'd been chasing was there all along, waiting for the technical precision to match the creative vision.

SAYLESS emerged not as an alter ego but as a philosophy. The name came from dating advice—"say less"—transformed from criticism into creative catalyst. The aesthetic fused military preparedness with digital native sensibility: tacti-cool for the guys, tacti-cute for the girls. A stencil font easily reproducible in the real world. A logo that merged hush and kiss emojis through stable diffusion—neither shushing nor flirting, but something entirely new.

"Love with the power to back it up" became the deeper philosophy. In a world with guns, playing without them meant death. But there had to be a reason to live, too. That reason was the music.

Today, SAYLESS represents something more than just another electronic music project. It's a proof of concept for the post-matrix creative. Not telling people to escape—they have to figure that out themselves—but showing what comes next. Open-source branding. Transparent process. "Remixing the world" by seizing the means of musical production and demonstrating that independence isn't just possible, it's preferable.

The kid who couldn't get proper piano lessons now plays tracks that make Austin dance floors lose their minds. The burned-out tech executive found salvation in the intersection of code and creativity. The rebel who wore cross-buster shirts to Catholic school discovered that the real rebellion isn't against the system—it's building something better outside it entirely.

Where does SAYLESS go from here?

"I don't know and that's why I'm excited."

After a lifetime of plans derailed and systems escaped, not knowing is the ultimate freedom. The tools are in place. The sound is dialed. The philosophy is clear. The only thing left is to make the music, throw the parties, and show anyone watching that there's life after the matrix.

And it sounds fucking incredible.
