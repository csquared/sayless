This ain't just about me anymore.

SAYLESS is a philosophy - it's a permission slip to stop explaining and just do the thing. 

And now is always the time for action.

To quote TS Eliot:
"Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?"

Will you - after tea, and cakes, and ices.
Have the strength to show up for something new?

Let the music speak.
Let the rhythm hold you.
March 6th, SAYLESS and dance with me.

Maggie Mae's has been on 6th Street since 1978.
That's forty-seven years of Austin music history. 

Forty-seven years of bands loading in, sound checks, opening acts hoping for a break, headliners delivering, Tuesday nights that were dead and Friday nights that were magic. 
The stage has held more musicians than anyone can count. 
The walls have absorbed more sound than any spectrogram could render.
And SAYLESS is about to be part of it.


It means the world to be playing this venue with history. 
It's not a pop-up. 
It's not a warehouse party that exists for one night and then dissolves. 
It's a place that has lasted, that has weathered decades of Austin's evolution—
the tech boom, 
the gentrification debates, 
the pandemic, 
the constant tension between "old Austin" and "new Austin." 

There's quite the resonance between SAYLESS and Maggie's.

Niether of us is new, and neither of us is done.

I'm not trying to be young.
I'm going for Good.
I'm going for real.
And I'm going for present, in the heart of it all.
